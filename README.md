# Welcome to the README for my online CV

## Why am I building this?

Since graduating from Makers Academy I have decided I want to focus on front end development. I have taken an online course in React where I followed a tutorial, this is my first attempt at building a React application from scratch on my own. I plan for it to be a single page online CV that will showcase my React, JavaScript, CSS and HTML skills. I plan to write about the process on my blog, and difficulties I come across and how I overcome them.

## Planning

Sections of the webpage-

- Navbar- I would like this to have links to different sections of the page, unsure at the moment how to do this as I plan to have just a single page rather than multiple
- Intro/About- Will include a heading with my name, a photo and a short paragraph introduction
- Skills - soft and technical. List of soft skills with a small plus button to click which will expand for more details.
- Projects - 3 projects next to each other, each with a title, photo and short description below. Title will be a link to the project.
- Experience - Unsure how I would like to present past work exp at the moment
- Blog - 3 featured blog posts, Each with title which is a link to the post, possibly pictures too?
- Hobbies - 3 hobbies with photos of each that change every 5 seconds.
- Contact - Form to send an email and get in contact

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
